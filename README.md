# The Dropin Protocol

## What is a Dropin?

A Dropin is a simple, powerful tool for giving an AI context and memory. It's a short, structured block of text that you place at the beginning of a conversation to instantly "bootstrap" an AI, telling it who to be, what to know, and what its goal is.

Think of it as a **mission briefing for your AI.**

Using a simple but strict syntax (`Key=Value`, `Section:Topic`), a dropin transforms a generic, stateless AI into a specialized assistant that is already up to speed on your project, persona, or specific problem, saving you the time and frustration of repeating yourself.
